# Installation

- From PowerShell Gallery:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name "Logic.Monitor"
```

# Upgrading

- New releases are published often, to ensure you have the latest version you can run:

```powershell
Update-Module -Name "Logic.Monitor"
```

# General Usage

Before you can use on module commands you will need to be connected to a LM portal. To connect your LM portal use the **Connect-LMAccount** command:

```powershell
Connect-LMAccount -AccessId "lm_access_id" -AccessKey "lm_access_key" -AccountName "lm_portal_prefix_name"
```

Once connected you can then run an appropriate command, a full list of commands available can be found using:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module "Logic.Monitor"
```

To disconnect from an account simply run the Disconnect-LMAccount command:

```powershell
Disconnect-LMAccount
```

To cache credentials for multiple portals you can use the command New-LMCachedAccount, once a credential has been cached you can reference it when connecting to an lm portal using the -UserCachedCredentials switch in Connect-LMAccount.

Cached credentials are stored in a LocalVault using **Microsoft's SecretManagement** module. If its your first time using SecretManagement you will be prompted to set up a password for accessing your cached accounts in the LocalVault using this method.

```powershell
New-LMCachedAccount -AccessId "lm_access_id" -AccessKey "lm_access_key" -AccountName "lm_portal_prefix_name"
Connect-LMAccount -UseCachedCredential

#Example output when using cached credentials
#Selection Number | Portal Name
#0) portalname
#1) portalnamesandbox
#Enter the number for the cached credential you wish to use: 1
#Connected to LM portal portalnamesandbox using account
```

# Change List

## 7.6

### New Cmdlets
- **New-LMUptimeDevice**: Create LogicMonitor Uptime monitors (web or ping) using the v3 device endpoint.
- **Get-LMUptimeDevice**: Retrieve existing Uptime devices with support for filtering by type or internal/external status.
- **Set-LMUptimeDevice**: Update Uptime device configuration, including alert thresholds, locations, and scripted steps.
- **Remove-LMUptimeDevice**: Delete Uptime devices individually.

### New Helper Cmdlets
- **ConvertTo-LMUptimeDevice** Migration cmdlet relies will take a provided set of WebChecks/PingChecks and convert them to LMUptime Resources.

### Bug Fixes/Changes
- Added reusable helper functions to normalise global alert condition inputs and location validation for Uptime cmdlets.

### Notes
- API calls for LM Uptime will only work on LM portals running v228 or later.
- LMUptime resources with show under normal **\*-LMDevice** cmdlets but modification to them should be handled by the new **\*-LMUptimeDevice** cmdlets.

### Examples
```powershell
# Create a new external web uptime check
New-LMUptimeDevice -Name "shop.example.com" -GroupIds '123' -Domain 'shop.example.com' -TestLocationAll

# Update an existing uptime device by name
Set-LMUptimeDevice -Name "shop.example.com" -Description "Updated uptime monitor" -GlobalSmAlertCond half

# Remove an uptime device
Remove-LMUptimeDevice -Name "shop.example.com"

# Migrate legacy websites to uptime and disable their alerting
Get-LMWebsite -Type Webcheck | ConvertTo-LMUptimeDevice -TargetHostGroupIds '123' -DisableSourceAlerting
```

### Major Changes in v7:
 - **API Headers**: Updated all API request headers to use a custom User-Agent (Logic.Monitor-PowerShell-Module/Version) for usage reporting on versions deployed.

### Documentation Overhaul
We're excited to announce our new comprehensive documentation site at [https://logicmonitor.github.io/lm-powershell-module-docs/](https://logicmonitor.github.io/lm-powershell-module-docs/). The site includes:

### New Filter Wizard
Introducing the Filter Wizard, a new interactive tool to help build complex filters:
- Visual filter construction
- Support for all filter operators
- Real-time filter preview
- Available through `Build-LMFilter` or `-FilterWizard` parameter

```powershell
# Use the standalone filter builder
Build-LMFilter

# Use built-in filter wizard parameter
Get-LMDeviceGroup -FilterWizard
```
